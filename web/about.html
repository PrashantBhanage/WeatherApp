  <h2>Who We Are?</h2>

  <div class="highlight-block">
    <p>
      AQI was built on a simple but powerful idea — everyone deserves to know
      what they are breathing. Understanding air quality is the first step
      toward protecting your health and living a cleaner, safer life.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are an open-source air quality monitoring platform that provides
      real-time air quality data for your location. AQI doesn’t just show
      numbers — it helps you understand what those numbers mean and how they
      affect your daily life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our platform allows you to track air pollution levels in your city,
      monitor air quality in homes, offices, and workplaces, and stay informed
      about changing environmental conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Along with real-time insights, AQI also offers practical guidance and
      preventive plans to help you reduce exposure to air pollution.
    </p>

    <p>
      For users of Prana Air monitors, AQI provides a dedicated dashboard that
      makes it easy to analyze, visualize, and manage air quality data from
      connected devices — all in one place.
    </p>

    <p class="strong-line">
      At its core, AQI exists to empower people with information, awareness,
      and tools — because clean air should never be a mystery.
